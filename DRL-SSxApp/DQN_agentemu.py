# ## **Objective**
#
# The objective is to maximize the overall throughput for all slices by mapping
# resource blocks (RBs) while ensuring minimum QoS agreements are met and
# maximum thresholds for each slice are upheld via secure slicing:

# $ \\max\_{T_1, T_2, T_3} \\sum\_{i=1}^{3} T_i $

# where $ T_1 $, $ T_2 $, and $ T_3 $ represent the throughput for URLLC, eMBB,
# and Medium slices, respectively.

# ## **Constraints**

# The optimization problem is subject to the following constraints:

# 1.  **QoS Constraint for URLLC:** The throughput of URLLC must satisfy the
#     ultra-reliable and low-latency requirement while being constrained by the
#     minimum QoS threshold for the Medium slice. This can be expressed as:

# $ \\theta\_{\\text{min}} < \\text{QoS}\_{\\text{URLLC}}(T_1) <
# \\theta\_{\\text{URLLC}} $

# where $ \\theta\_{\\text{URLLC}} $ is the minimum QoS threshold for the URLLC
# slice and $ \\theta\_{\\text{min}} $ is the minimum QoS threshold for the
# Medium slice.

# 2.  **QoS Constraint for eMBB:** The throughput of eMBB must meet the enhanced
#     broadband requirement:

# $ \\text{QoS}\_{\\text{eMBB}}(T_2) \\geq \\theta\_{\\text{eMBB}} \\quad
# \\text{(high data rate requirement)} $

# where $ \\theta\_{\\text{eMBB}} $ is the minimum QoS threshold for the eMBB
# slice.

# 3.  **QoS Constraint for Medium Slice:** The throughput of the Medium slice
#     must satisfy its QoS requirements, which is between URLLC and eMBB:

# $ \\theta\_{\\text{URLLC}} \\leq \\text{QoS}\_{\\text{Medium}}(T_3) \\leq
# \\theta\_{\\text{eMBB}} $

# 4.  **Resource Allocation Constraint:** The total allocated resources
#     (Physical Resource Blocks) for all slices cannot exceed the available
#     resources $ R\_{\\text{total}} $:

# $ \\sum\_{i=1}^{3} R_i \\leq R\_{\\text{total}} $

# where $ R_i $ is the resource allocation for slice $ i $.

# 5.  **Secure Slicing Constraint:** All UEs in the slice must operate below the
#     maximum threshold; otherwise, they are considered malicious and may
#     compromise the resources of legitimate UEs. Let $ \\tau\_{\\text{max}} $
#     represent the maximum allowable resource usage per UE. The constraint can
#     be expressed as:

# $ S\_{u,i} < \\tau\_{\\text{max}}, \\quad \\forall u \\in U_i $

# where $ S\_{u,i} $ is the resource usage for UE $ u $ in slice $ i $, and $
# U_i $ is the set of UEs in slice $ i $.

# ## **Approach**

# ![](../documentation/images/drl-ss-xapp-1.png)

# The diagram outlines a framework for allocating physical resource blocks
# (PRBs) among user equipment (UE) slices using a Deep Reinforcement Learning
# (DRL) agent in a secure slicing xApp environment.

# #### Key Components
#
# - **DRL Agent**: Uses Key Performance Metrics (KPM) as input, actions for PRB
#   reallocation, and network throughput as the reward. The agent's operations
#   include:
#   - **State**: Input from KPM.
#   - **Action**: Adjust PRB allocations.
#   - **Reward**: Based on network throughput performance.
# - **Slice Configurator**: Implements the DRL agentâ€™s actions by reallocating
#   PRBs to slices.
# - **Secure Slicing xApp**: Executes resource adjustments and handles UE
#   security.
# - **UE Instances**: Devices bound to slices, with the potential to be moved to
#   a secure slice if detected as malicious.
# - **iperf3 Server**: Generates traffic in the Downlink for user traffic.

# #### DRL Agent Actions
#
# 1 - 3. **Increase PRBs**: Adds 5 PRBs if a slice's throughput is insufficient
# but below or equal to the SLA. Removes 5 PRB if throughput exceeds the SLA
# requirements and gives 0 reward for that episode. 4. **Secure UE**: Moves UEs
# to a secure slice if malicious behavior is detected.

# #### Workflow
#
# 1.  The DRL agent receives real-time KPM data and adjusts PRBs through the
#     Slice Configurator.
# 2.  The iperf3 server provides throughput feedback to guide resource
#     allocation.
# 3.  A reward function evaluates actions to maximize UE throughput while
#     ensuring fairness and preventing malicious activity.

# #### Security & Fairness
#
# - **Proportional Fairness**: Ensures balanced PRB allocation across slices.
# - **Secure Slicing**: Isolates malicious UEs, allocating no PRBs to them, to
#   protect network integrity.

# ## **srsRAN Scheduling Breakdown and System Model**

# ![](../documentation/images/ssxapp.png)

# In srsRAN 4G, the configuration provided maps resource blocks (RBs) based on
# several key parameters. With SISO (Single Input, Single Output) and
# transmission mode (TM1), the system allocates RBs across the physical layer
# considering bandwidth (bw=10), which corresponds to a 10 MHz system, and the
# subframe configuration. The scheduler assigns RBs dynamically based on user
# demands, channel conditions, and available bandwidth. The MCS (modulation and
# coding scheme) is set to automatic, allowing the system to adaptively select
# the most efficient scheme. PDSCH and PUSCH are then mapped to these allocated
# RBs for downlink and uplink transmissions, optimizing the use of the available
# frequency-time resources.

# We have 50 RBs in 10 MHz and 100 in 20 Mhz. We have alot more than this though
# since they are virtualized for the purpose of the DRL-SSxApp.

# process, such as the number of episodes, maximum timesteps, and exploration
# rate.


# Initializes the agent, environment, and training parameters. Loops through
# episodes, with each episode consisting of a sequence of timesteps. At each
# timestep, the agent chooses an action based on the current state and
# exploration rate. The environment responds with a reward and next state. The
# agent updates its experience buffer with the current state, action, reward,
# and next state. The agent updates its Q-network using the experience buffer.
# The exploration rate is decayed over time to encourage exploitation. The
# training process is repeated for a specified number of episodes. The trained
# model is saved to a file.

# ### **Get State**
#
# This function, get_state, simulates a state in a network slicing environment
# by randomly selecting data from three types of slices (eMBB, Medium, and
# UrLLC) and calculating the number of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) based on
# the selected data and a set of predefined rates (DL_BYTE_TO_PRB_RATES). The
# function also introduces a chance of one slice becoming "malicious" and
# increasing its DL bytes. The function returns the calculated PRBs for each
# slice.
